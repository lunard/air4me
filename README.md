# Air4Me

I like social projects and this aims to be a collaborative project.
The purpose is to allow everyone to contribute to map the air quality during his own mobility:
are you going to work, are you walking, are you traveling?
Takes with you the air4me sensor and install the air4me app: you will help to integrate air quality data and you will able to air see the air quality near to you!
